The application is based on the AlphaFold2 algorithm, which is a deep learning model that predicts protein structures from sequence data.

The ColabFold application is available on the Clinical Proteomics Sandbox website and can be accessed at UCloud. \n\n### Getting Started\nYou can access ColabFold through UCloud. This integration allows you to use the tool, but before beginning the ColabFold workshop, you need to download the workshop as a Jupyter Notebook from [GitHub](https://github.com/hds-sandbox/AlphaFold_Workshop) and upload it to your designated folder on UCloud. To initiate this process, please follow the steps below:\n\n1. Log in to UCloud.  \n2. Choose a workspace that has GPU resources for optimal performance.  \n3. Access the application menu by clicking on **Apps** in the left-hand side menu.  \n![UCloud Applications](images/UCloud/UCloud_apps.png){width=250 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n4. Search for **ColabFold** and click on the icon for the application.  \n![](images/UCloud/ColabFold_app.png){width=500 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n5. Choose the appropriate machine type and select a GPU, such as **u2-gpu-1**. The use of a single GPU is generally sufficient, though larger sequences may require additional computational power.  \n![](images/UCloud/Machine_type.png){width=750 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n6. Deploy your own personal folder by selecting **Folder** and adjusting the path to your directory. Be sure to select the correct **Workspace** and change the **Drive** to where you want your data to be stored, if needed. Click on the folder name to select it and then click **Use this folder** in the upper right corner of the pop-up window.  \n![](images/UCloud/Add_folder.png){width=750 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n7. Click on \"Submit\" and then \"Open interface\" on the following page.  \n![](images/UCloud/Submit_open_interface.png){width=500 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n8. Prior to proceeding, ensure you've downloaded the Jupyter Notebook labeled **AlphaFold2.ipynb** from [the Github repository](https://github.com/hds-sandbox/AlphaFold_Workshop). Then, upload the notebook to your ColabFold session using the left-hand menu.\n\n9.

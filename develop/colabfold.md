!!! note "Section Overview"

    &#128368; **Time Estimation:** 4 hours

    &#128172; **Learning Objectives:**    
        1. Explain the process of predicting protein structures based on amino acid sequences using the ColabFold web application.  
        2. Utilize the ColabFold web application within the UCloud environment to perform complex computational tasks with optimal performance.  
        3. Understand the metrics used by AlphaFold2 to predict protein structure models and how they relate to the confidence and accuracy of the predictions.  

## Introduction    

ColabFold is a web application that allows users to predict protein structures from sequence data. The application is based on the AlphaFold2 algorithm, which is a deep learning model that predicts protein structures from sequence data. The ColabFold application is a simplified version of the AlphaFold2 algorithm, which is designed to be used by non-computational researchers. The ColabFold application is available on the Clinical Proteomics Sandbox website and can be accessed at UCloud. 

### Getting Started
As a non-computational user, you can access ColabFold through UCloud. This integration allows you to use the tool, but before beginning the ColabFold workshop, you need to download the workshop as a Jupyter Notebook from [GitHub](https://github.com/hds-sandbox/AlphaFold_Workshop) and upload it to your designated folder on UCloud. To initiate this process, please follow the steps below:

:one: Log in to UCloud.  
:two: Choose a workspace that has GPU resources for optimal performance.  
:three: Search for ColabFold in the Apps section.  
:four: Choose the appropriate machine type and select a GPU, such as u2-gpu-1. The use of a single GPU is generally sufficient, though larger sequences may require additional computational power.  
:five: Select a personal folder to use, ensuring that you have uploaded the Jupyter Notebook from GitHub beforehand.  
:six: Click on "Submit" and then "Open interface" on the following page.  
:seven: Proceed with the ColabFold workshop, which will guide you through the process of predicting protein structures based on amino acid sequences.  


### Efficient Super-Computing with ColabFold
!!! info "Advantages of using ColabFold at UCloud"
    1. ColabFold at UCloud provides access to super-computing power, enabling users to perform complex computational tasks quickly and efficiently.  
    2. The user-friendly interface of ColabFold and UCloud's interactive HPC-environment make it easy for non-computational users to access and utilize the tool.  
    3. Using ColabFold at UCloud can be a cost-effective solution for those who require access to super-computing power, as it eliminates the need for expensive hardware or software investments and offers a pay-per-use basis instead.

# Analyzing Clinical Proteomics Data Using FragPipe

!!! note "Section Overview"

    &#128368; **Time Estimation:** 4-6 hours

    &#128172; **Learning Objectives:**    
        1. Understand the principles of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and how it can be used to study clinical samples.  
        2. Learn how to use FragPipe to process and analyze clinical proteomics data, including data preprocessing, quality control, and statistical analysis.  
        3. Gain hands-on experience in interpreting FragPipe outputs and using them to generate biological insights from clinical proteomics data.  

This workshop is designed for biomedical students who want to learn how to analyze clinical proteomics data using FragPipe. The workshop will cover the basic principles of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and its applications in clinical research. Participants will learn how to use FragPipe to process and analyze clinical proteomics data, including data preprocessing, quality control, and statistical analysis. The workshop will also provide hands-on experience in interpreting FragPipe outputs and using them to generate biological insights from clinical proteomics data. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use FragPipe to analyze clinical proteomics data and gain skills that can be applied in their future research.

!!! danger "Important Warning"
    1. When working within the Proteomics Sandbox application, **it is crucial to ensure that all your work is saved in the designated 'work' directory**. Failure to do so may result in permanent loss of your work when the session ends or expires.  
    2. It is imperative to **keep track of the time allocated for your UCloud job**. Upon expiry, the session will terminate automatically, resulting in loss of unsaved work. It is possible to extend the number of hours for your session after it has commenced.

# Introduction to Mass-Spectrometry Based Proteomics

**Proteomics** is the large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions. As proteins are essential components of living organisms, understanding them is crucial for elucidating biological processes and disease mechanisms. **Mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics** is a powerful technique that allows for the comprehensive analysis of proteins in a given sample.

## Data Generation in Proteomics

The process starts with the extraction of proteins from a biological sample. These proteins are then digested into smaller peptides, usually using an enzyme like trypsin. The resulting peptides are separated by liquid chromatography and then ionized before being introduced into a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer measures the mass-to-charge ratio of the peptides, generating spectra that represent the peptideâ€™s mass and its fragments. These spectra are then used to infer the peptide's sequence and, ultimately, the identity and quantity of the proteins in the sample.
